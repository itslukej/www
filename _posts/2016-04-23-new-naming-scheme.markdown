Today we have started using a new naming scheme for SuperBNC servers. Servers will now
be named after [Norse gods and goddesses](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Norse_gods_and_goddesses) 
starting with the NL server, which has been renamed to Aegir. We also hope to have a 
new account request system up in the next couple of months. As always, stay tuned for 
more updates.
