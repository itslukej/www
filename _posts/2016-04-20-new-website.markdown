Welcome to our shiny new website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and you can view the source
files [here](https://github.com/SuperBNC/www). This site is still in development but
it will contain ToS, a list of our channels, a list of blocked/suspended networks and
a list of servers (although we currently only have 1 server but plan to get more if and
when there is the demand to justify it). We hope to implement a request form at some
point in the future too, but that will depend on another project so it won't be until
after that is completed. That's it for now, stay tuned for more updates.
